Color Image Compression

Color images are converted to pixel data and then compressed using various clustering techniques. Algorithms used are winner take all, k-means and Kohonen.

Prerequisites:
Jupyter-lab
Python 3.7
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
skimage
PIL

Running:
Running Main.ipynb imports the image being analyzed and runs the three different algorithms.
Output_image.ipynb outputs the image based on the data from running Main.ipynb
evaluation.ipynb outputs data based on the data running from Main.ipynb
